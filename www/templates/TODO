Idea: make it as flexible as possible without confusing people
Market segments:
 - the cheap $10 / Lentils
 - the gourmet
 - the big feast

Use cases:
 - need to talk to communicate details (Facebook, how good the meal was)
 - flat dinners (equally split the meal)
 - really nice gourmet meals (needs a meal description)
 - share meal invite with others (invite by facebook message)
 - I want to do the meal multiple tims over


Trade-off between information specificity and the information amount that the user can handle
As they can handle less, the information can be less specific as its more unique anyways. Conversely too.
